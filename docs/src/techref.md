## Real-Time

A real-time system is one that assures certain deadlines are met reliably within expected time constraints. See this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a> for a more complete definition.  

!!! tip "Recommended Reading"

    <a href="https://shuhaowu.com/blog/2022/01-linux-rt-appdev-part1.html" target="_blank">This</a> series of blog posts by Shuhao Wu is an excellent, easy to read distillation of numerous resources on real-time computing. This is highly recommended reading to provide context to some of the topics that will be discussed in this section.

Using a real-time architecture and approach in MODAQ allows better management of sources of latency and reduction of jitter. What this means in practical terms is that certain time-critical loops, processes, or functions can execute deterministically and that variation in timing of successive iterations is kept low.  

### Latency

Opening Task Manager in Windows or the equivalent in in other operating systems (OS), there may be hundreds of processes listed that are all vying for a slice of the CPU's time. These include things like device drivers, software updaters, user software, malware detectors, and lots of other things that comprise the modern computing experience. With fast, multi-core processors, these appear to be seamlessly juggled, usually with little delay apparent to the user. This is all managed by the scheduler and it tries to be fair as it doles out access to a CPU core. Under critical analysis, an application may have to wait a non-deterministic amount of time for that CPU attention- and that wait time might vary considerably for each request. This variation may be only a few milliseconds (or longer) but for DAQs running loops hundreds or several thousand times per second, that's an eternity. 
 
A properly configured real-time stack offers the software developer some tools to better manage how the real-time code gets its CPU time by preempting lower priority processes (jumping to the head of the line). The end effect is that the real-time code should experience less of this source of latency.

!!! info

    <b>Determinism</b>
    <p>
    A deterministic real-time system should complete a task within a bound time period in a consistent and repeatable manner. 

Different real-time approaches yield better or worse maximum latency periods. Specific project requirements or use-cases often dictate the maximum acceptable latency for a particular application. This is most common for safety-critical systems, such as an anti-lock brake controller, where missing a deadline can result in disaster. These will often be associated with terms such as "guaranteed" or "hard" real-time. From a system architecture and software development standpoint, achieving this level of latency and determinism is difficult and probably not practical nor even necessary for a DAQ such as M2. 

However, in the space between extremely low latency, safety-critical, real-time systems and general purpose operating systems without real-time support, there is <a href="https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/realtime/start" target="_blank">Real-Time Linux</a>. Or, more correctly, the PREEMPT_RT patch for Linux kernels.   

### Real-Time Linux 

Linux with the PREEMPT_RT patch has been successfully used in various industries such as automotive, space, and industrial automation for years and by organizations including National Instruments, NASA, and SpaceX.[^1][^2] This lends confidence that it's appropriate for M2 applications.

At the time of writing, it appears that the mainline Linux kernel is expected to gain real-time support[^3] in a coming release. Until that happens, it's necessary to <a href="https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Miscellaneous/Building-Realtime-rt_preempt-kernel-for-ROS-2.html" target="_blank">manually compile the kernel with the PREEMPT_RT patch</a> or find a distribution for an already patched RT kernel.   

### Validating RT Performance

Once patched kernel has been installed and the necessary changes to BIOS have been made, it's necessary to conduct some tests on the system to validate the 'as-built' latency performance. 

A very useful tool for this is provided by intel: <a href="https://eci.intel.com/docs/3.3/development/performance/benchmarks.html#about-rtpm" target="_blank">RTPM</a>. This tool will evaluate the settings on your computer to ensure they are optimized for real-time performance. It also will conduct several tests that will characterize your real-time performance.

## Precision Time Protocol

The promise of PTP is that all connected PTP-aware devices will be synchronized and reference-time accurate to 100's, if not 10's of nanoseconds- without drift. By comparison, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol" target="_blank">Network Time Protocol</a> (NTP), which is what most consumer computers and laptops use as a time reference, can at best achieve 10's of milliseconds accuracy. While NTP accuracy might be perfectly acceptable to some and often better than a real time clock (which can drift <a href="https://www.best-microcontroller-projects.com/ppm.html" target="-blank">several seconds a day</a>), it's a ~6 order of magnitude difference in accuracy as compared to PTP. If a quality time reference is not available, samples taken from input modules on the same DAQ controller will be disciplined by the same clock and will likely be <i>precisely</i> timestamped relative each other, but may not be <i>accurate</i> to actual time (i.e. UTC) . 

Where the real power of PTP is realized is in synchronizing samples taken by disparate systems. These can be DAQs on the same subnet, sharing the same master clock or systems completely disconnected from each other and separated miles apart. As long as each system is disciplined to a healthy PTP reference clock, the samples will be synchronized to the aforementioned nanosecond time precision. This is a boon for distributed architectures and system design flexibility, allowing multi-controller synchronization without physical interconnections. 

In our experience, PTP implementation either works magically or is a real bear. It does help to have some knowledge of networking and configuring managed switches. PTP requires the following for optimal performance:

1. PTP time server
2. PTP-capable endpoints (e.g. M2 controller, ethernet based devices)
3. PTP services configured and running on the endpoints
4. PTP-capable network switch

These items need to be properly configured, otherwise the PTP performance may be degraded or non-existent.

## Heading

Getting a reliable estimate of heading on a fixed or semi-stationary device can be tricky. Devices that rely on Earth's magnetic field need to be calibrated in-situ and have the proper magnetic declination correction applied. 

Since a calibration procedure generally requires rotating the sensor 360° in one or more axis, this is often difficult or near impossible once the sensor is mounted on the device (WEC, buoy, etc). It's easier to calibrate the compass prior to installation, however this is not effective, since the magnetic field will most likely be distorted by the presence of hard and soft iron sources near the mounting location.
